# Emergency Department Oral Health Data

States collect emergency emergency department data to understand utilization patterns, cost, and reasons people access health care. The Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) consolidates some of these state datasets into the Health Care Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Some of the data is free and publicly queryable in the HCUPnet online database. Most states do not participate. ED data collection therefore requires coordinating with many states individually. They may or may not use standardized reporting fields, somewhat complicating consolidation into our database. States may charge fees as well.

## Utility

The emergency department is not the ideal acces point for most oral health conditions. The dental office is usually much more appropriate, where dentists have the expertise to manage traumatic and non-traumatic dental cases. Emergency department care is much more expensive than dental office care. Emergency department use for dental reasons may illuminate gaps in health literacy, dental insurance coverage, or the availability of dentists. States often turn to ED data to see if utilization changes as result of changes to Medicaid dental coverage, the thought being that when people don't have dental insurance they are less likely to see a dentist and more likely to go to a hospital. 

### Questions this dataset could help answer

* What was the count of non-traumtic dental conditions in my state in 2016?
* What was the rate of visits to the emergency department for any dental reason in 2015 per 100,000 people?
* Which race/ethnicity and which income levels are most likely to visit the emergency room for a preventable dental condition?
* How does my state compare to other states on ED dental utilization?
* What were the total charges for dental ED visits in my state in 2016?
* Did national rates of ED visits change before and after 2018?
