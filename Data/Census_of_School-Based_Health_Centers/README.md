# The Census of School-Based Health Centers



## Utility

School-based health centers are an important access point for oral health care in many communities. This dataset helps us understand how many school-based health centers are providing oral healthcare in states.

The Census of School-Based Health Centers has 3 indicators that are part of the National Oral Health Surveillance System:
* Number of school-based health centers providing dental sealants
* Number of school-based health centers providing dental care
* Number of school-based health centers providing topical fluoride

### Questions this dataset could help answer

* How many school-based health centers in Alaska provided dental sealants in 2016-2017?
* Which states did not have any school-based health centers providing dental services in 2016-2017?
* Did Georgia have more school-based health centers providing topical fluoride or dental sealants?

## Orientation & Stewardship  

The Census of School-Based Health Centers is conducted by the School-Based Health Alliance on a periodic bases. The [most recent survey](https://www.sbh4all.org/school-health-care/national-census-of-school-based-health-centers/) was conducted during the 2016-2017 school year. State level data is not available on their website for public download but a file was provided to ASTDD for this project.

## Data Structure

The file provided to ASTDD contains 4 columns: 
* State
* Count of SBHCs providing any oral health service
* Count of SBHCs providing dental sealants
* Coutn of SBHCs providing topical fluoride

No code was necessary to process the data before visualization. The 3 service columns were unpivoted in Microsoft Excel to have a database format to read into Tableau.
