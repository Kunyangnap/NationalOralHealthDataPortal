# Centers for Disease Control & Prevention United States Cancer Statistics 

The United Stats Cancer Statistics program at the CDC provides national, state, and county-level incidence and mortality of many types of cancers, including oral and pharyngeal cancer.

## Examples of questions this dataset could help answer

* What was the incidence of oral or pharyngeal cancer higher in Lake or Cook counties in Illinois?
* Which state has the higest mortality from oral or pharyngeal cancer? 
* Are men or women more likely to have died from oral or pharyngeal cancer in Utah for 2013-2017?

## Utility

The United States Cancer Statistics ("UCS") program aggregates cancer data from several projects like the national SEER program and individual state-based cancer surveillance registries to provide standardized data tables that can help compare across geographies.

## Orientation & Stewardship  

The CDC provides several ways to view or receive United States cancer data. On one end they have a [dataviz tool](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/dataviz/index.htm) for viewing quick maps. On the more detailed end, users can apply for [access raw data](https://seer.cancer.gov/data/access.html) in the SEER registry. In our case we want to use the [pre-analyzed data tables](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/dataviz/download_data.htm) where all the measures are already calculated in a delimited ASCII file.

## Original Data Structure

By downloading the 1999-2017 zip file, users receive 11 pipe-delimited text files covering different aggregations by age, sex, geography, and cancer type. The typical format is for each row to be a unique state-race-age-cancer_type-measure. The only tricky part is that adjusted and adjusted rates are in separate columns and must be unpivoted on your own.

Estimates are given for each year going back to 1999. Estimates are also given for some grouped years, like 2013-2017.

## Converted Data Structure

We take data from three of the zipped text files:
* **BYSITE.TXT**. Provides national estiamtes.
* **BYAREA_COUNTY.TXT**. Provides county estimates.
* **BYAREA.TXT**. Provides state estimates.

Using statistical software we modify each file and aggregate them together. We unpivot the adjusted and unajusted columns so that there is just one column describing the adjustment used. Then we save a version that contains all the estimates (SEER_prime.csv) and a file containing the 95% confidence intervals unpivoted such that the upper and lower confidence intervals each get their own row for each state-race-sex-measure-adjustement. 

Our **SEER_CI.csv** was too large to save in this repository so it has been saved in a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HURIwjabAUeyVWq7K9LHXR4iVyj2-qvw/view?usp=sharing).

## Issues & decisions

A decision was made not to do a time series in Tableau. Instead, only the grouped 2013-2017 estimates are shown. The confidence intervals seem quite wide, even for the combined 2013-2017 estimates, so we're not sure it would be that helpful to show individual year data.

Most United States counties are not included in the county-level dataset because of data suppression an unavailabilit. But we've gone ahead and shown what we do have on a map.

## Code

The R code **CANCER_master.R** found in this GitHub repository folder takes in three USCS text tiles and outputs the two CSVs described above.

## Tableau Presentation

The Tableau presentaiton has three tabs: 

* States Comparison
* Counties Comparison
* Race / Sex Comparison

## Status & Next Steps

When the next year of data is available, it will be included.

Should we do a time-series presentation?
