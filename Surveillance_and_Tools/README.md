# Surveillance & Tools

This section of the National Oral Health Data Portal contains visualizations that are made up of several of the data sources found in the Data folder. Here, were bring together datasets that make sense to be viewed together.

Some of these presentations are for user convenience. For example, the COVID-19 dashboard puts into one screen what is happening across the ADA HPI COVID poll, Bureau of Labor Statistics employment and wage data, and COVID case and death rate data from the CDC. 

Other presentations are of suites of measures that organizations have said should be considered together. These include the National Oral Health Surveillance System indicators and the Healthy People Objectives. Each of these programs draws upon multiple datasets that can be found individually in our Data folder, but we present the information here as well, consolidated in a simple view.
