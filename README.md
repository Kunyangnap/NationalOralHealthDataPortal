# Welcome

Welcome to the National Oral Health Data Portal GitHub Repository, a project of the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors with funding from Delta Dental of Michigan and GlaxoSmithKline.

Our aim is to build the country's first ever national oral health data portal, consolidating all our important oral health data sources in one place for people from all levels of oral health and data literacy to find the information they need. We're consolidating datasets on oral health status, attitudes, cost, utilization, and access to care and organizing them into files and visualizations. You can follow along with our progress on this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OHPj2bzg04T6bpg6xSCKNxwQx-ANpdBcE48GLHRCntA/edit?usp=sharing) or by tracking changes to this repository.

Have questions? Want to help out? Have code to contribute? Feel free to reach out to [John O'Malley](mailto:jjomalley3@gmail.com) or go ahead and make some pull requests.
